# BbBBot

A Tiki Bartender recipe bot built using the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com). Built using Node.js with support for custom events with [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/). Inspired by the recipes of my favorite "Bum".

Everything is still very early, so please be kind.

## Still Left To Do
1. Add recipes and store them in a database (likely using DocumentDB).
2. Work out all of the conversation intents.
3. Create templates for deployment on Microsoft Azure.

## Installation

1. Deploy Bot service.
2. Train and publish LUIS Model for intents.
3. Deploy Application Insights.
4. Configure and deploy Node.js app on Azure App Service.
